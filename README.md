# Arduino-Nano-LCD

# Hello All! Thanks for checking out my project.

# In this project, I soldered a 4 Digit 7 Segment display to an Arduino Nano via perfboard.
# Afterwards, I programmed the arduino to accept serial signals from my Python script, and print out a number on the LCD based on the serial input.
# In this case, I sent a 1 to the arduino every time I clicked my mouse on my PC. 
# mouseCounter.ino is now obsolete, mouseCounterv2.ino is what I am currently running.

# Here are some of the places where I found inspiration and useful information:

# Python pynput module to detect mouse clicks:

# Now, know that the code and pictures are the final project, not the first project.
# I estimate it took me about 20 hours, from conception to completion.
# Of those 20 hours, I estimate it took 10 to troubleshoot. There was some frustration...
# But here it is! I hope you enjoy and can learn something from it.
